Simple Linear Regression
- method to help us understand the relationship between two variables - X, Y
- the result of linear regression is a linear function that predicts the dependent variable as a function of the independent variable
- Yhat = a + bX
  - a = inercept of regression line 0
  - b = slope of regression line

Multiple Linear Regression
- used to explain relationship between one conntinuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables
- Yhat = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + b3X3 + ...

Polynomial Regression
- particular case of the general linear regression model or multiple linear regression models
- non-linear relationships by setting higher-order terms of the predictor variables
- ex: Yhat = a + b1X^2 + b2X^2 + b3X^3 (cubic - 3rd order)
- analytical expression for Multivariate Polynomial function gets complicated
  - ex: second-order polynomial with two variables : 𝑌ℎ𝑎𝑡=𝑎+𝑏1𝑋1+𝑏2𝑋2+𝑏3𝑋1𝑋2+𝑏4𝑋21+𝑏5𝑋22
- data pipelines simplify the steps of processing data
  - create pipeline by creating list of tuples including name of model/estimator and corresponding constructor
  - input list as argument to pipeline constructor
  - normalize data, perform transform, annd fit the model simultaneously
  - as well as predict simultaneously
  
Decision Making: Determining a Good Model Fit
- what is a good R-squared value?
  - model with higher R-squared value is a better fit for the data
- what is a good MSE?
  - model with smallest MSE is a better fit for the data
