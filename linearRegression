Simple Linear Regression
- method to help us understand the relationship between two variables - X, Y
- the result of linear regression is a linear function that predicts the dependent variable as a function of the independent variable
- Yhat = a + bX
  - a = inercept of regression line 0
  - b = slope of regression line

Multiple Linear Regression
- used to explain relationship between one conntinuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables
- Yhat = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + b3X3 + ...

Polynomial Regression
- particular case of the general linear regression model or multiple linear regression models
- non-linear relationships by setting higher-order terms of the predictor variables
- ex: Yhat = a + b1X^2 + b2X^2 + b3X^3 (cubic - 3rd order)
